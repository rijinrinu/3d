 1.1 Introduction

Currently there are individual sites for Contractor, Architect, and Designers in western countries, and very few in India. Right now, there’s no site that provide all the facility combined together. Visiting an architect for plan is expensive and also may not be always productive, this leads to build up in cost and also in wastage of time. 
   RAD – Realistic Architectural Design is a project that allow people to search Architects, Designers, and Contractors for the construction. All the interactions are done remotely through the user’s browser window. Users can use their email and password to register to the site. They can assign architects, designers, and contractors. The admin approves the Architects, Designers, and Contractors based on their proof and qualification. Users can see the Architects, Designers and Contractors after submitting their requirements. The plans, videos and work status are updated in the site for the user. RAD is a useful project for people looking to cut cost and also a platform for architects, designers, and contractors to get more customers.

1.2 Objectives

The main objective of this project is to build a platform where the user can find everything that is required to construct a building, from architects to constructors, under one roof. This also creates a platform for designers, contractors and architectures to get more customers based on their rating and quality of previous works. This also reduce the cost of middle men and time spent to find the suitable people for the construction project



























              2.SYSTEM ANALYSIS

	
INTRODUCTION
System analysis results in the specification of software’s operational characteristics; indicates software’s interface with other system elements and establishes constraints the software must meet. Requirement analysis allows the software engineer to elaborate on basic requirements established during earlier requirement engineering tasks and build models that depict user scenarios, functional activities, problem classes and their relationships, system and class behavior and flow of data as it is transformed. Requirement analysis provides the software designer with representation of information, function and behavior that can be translated to architectural, interface and component level designs. Finally, the analysis model and the requirement specification provide the development and the customs with the means to access quality once the software is built. The main requirement of this project is to eliminate the communication gap between a person who wants to build a home and the people needed for the process.

2.2 EXISTING SYSTEM
Currently there are individual sites for Contractor, Architect, and Designers in western countries, and very few in India. Right now, there’s no site that provide all the facility combined together. Visiting an architect for plan is expensive and also may not be always productive, this leads to build up in cost and also in wastage of time. The user may not get the plan they like and seeing architects after architects is a tiring process, not all would be able to afford appointments with number of architects. Limitations of existing system 
It takes so much time for meeting various architects and coming down to a plan. 
Consumption of working days. 
It leads in cost and the overall cost of the construction increases. 
Does not provide all the useful people from one source. 
Multiple sources for different people.
Not easy to keep track of workers and their payment.
2.3 PROPOSED SYSTEM
The proposed system is designed to eliminate all the disadvantages of the existing system. It is designed for keeping in mind all the drawbacks of the present system. This system allows the user to meet with the Architect, Designer and Contractor under a single website and even contact them if needed through email or contact number. This eliminates the process of going over to meet the Architects, Designer and wasting time, or face the peer pressured recommendations, also can assign a contractor for the construction business. All of the process happens under one roof, this all comes to this platform, this saves time and money of the customers, also this platform open opportunity for Architects, Designer and Contractors to get more customers and improve their career.

 Advantages of proposed system 
 
Saves time. 
Saves money. 
Reduce the stress of meeting a bunch of architects and designers. 
The basic needed people of construction under one roof.
     2.4 FEASIBILITY STUDY
During the system analysis study of the proposed system is carried out to see, whether it is beneficial to the organization. It is both needed and prudent to evaluate the feasibility of a project at the earliest time and minimum expenditure. Feasibility study is a test of system proposal access, its workability, impact on the organization, ability to meet the user needs, and effective use of resources. The different steps involved in feasibility analysis are.
Formation of a project team
Preparing the system flow chart
Enumerating the potential candidate system
Identifying the candidate system
The proposed system will help to solving the problem more efficiently and accurately. The reports obtained after feasibility studies are given below, they are:
Economic Feasibility
Technical Feasibility
Operational Feasibility.
ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY
It will reduce expenditure and improve the quality of service. A system can develop technically and that will used if the installed must still be a good investment for the public. Financial benefits must exceed the cost. In the case of proposed system, performance of the system is effective of its accuracy, faster response and user friendly in nature. The campus-wide community for events and placements reduce unnecessary expenses and wastage of many hours by its capabilities of fast operations.
TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY
Technical Feasibility checks the work for the project be done with current equipment, existing software technology and available personal. And if technology is required, what is the likelihood that it can develop. Also checks whether the proposed system guarantees accuracy, reliability, data security and ease of access. All the resources or implementing this software is available in this project.

OPERATIONAL FEASIBILITY
People are inherently to change, and computers have been known to facilitate chance. An estimate should be made about the reaction of the user, staff towards the development of a computerized system. Computer installations have something to do with turnover, transfer and changes in job status. Proposed projects are beneficial only if that can be turned in to information system that will meet the organizations operating requirements. In-operational feasibility study the management and users were found to have interest for a chance. Since the system is user friendly and training is less needed.


ANALYSIS MODELING
Software architecture involves the high-level structure of software system abstraction, by using decomposition and composition, with architectural style and quality attributes. A software architecture design must conform to the major functionality and performance requirements of the system, as well as satisfy the non-functional requirements such as reliability, scalability, portability and availability.
DATA FLOW DIAGRAM
Data flow diagrams are used widely for modeling the requirements’ show the flow of data through a system. The system may be a company, an organizational set of procedures, a computer hardware system, a software system or any combination of the proceedings. 
The DFD also known as a data flow graph or a bubble chart. The following observations about DFDs are important:  
All names should be unique. This makes easier to refer items in the DFD. Remember that a DFD is not a flow chart. 
Arrows in a flow chart represent the order of events; arrows in DFD represent flowing data. A DFD doesn’t imply any order of events. 
Suppress logical decisions (A diamond shape box is used in flow chart to represent decision points with multiple exit paths of which only one is taken). This implies an ordering of events, which makes no sense in DFD. 

       The following are some DFD symbols used in the project.





Rectangle: - It defines a source or destination of system data.




Circle: - It represents a process that transforms incoming data flow into outgoing data flow.





Arrow: - It defines data flow. It is a pipeline through which information flows.






Open rectangle: - It is used to store data or a temporary repository of data.

     2.5.2 ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM
The ER model is a conceptual data model that views the real world as a construct of entities and associations or relationships between entities. A basic component of the model is the EntityRelationship diagram, which is used to visually represent data objects. The ER modeling technique is frequently used for the conceptual design of database applications and many database applications, and many database design tools employ its concepts.

USECASE DIAGRAM

A use case diagram is used to represent the dynamic behavior of a system. It encapsulates the system's functionality by incorporating use cases, actors, and their relationships. It models the tasks, services, and functions required by a system/subsystem of an application. It depicts the high-level functionality of a system and also tells how the user handles a system. The main purpose of a use case diagram is to portray the dynamic aspect of a system. It accumulates the system's requirement, which includes both internal as well as external influences. It invokes persons, use cases, and several things that invoke the actors and elements accountable for the implementation of use case diagrams. It represents how an entity from the external environment can interact with a part of the system.

SYSTEM SPECIFICATION
In this section the hardware and software requirements essentially needed for the proposed system or the project is described
SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT
The software requirements specification (SRS) is a means of translating the ideas in the minds of clients into a formal documentation. This document forms the development and software validation. The basic reason for the difficulty in software requirement specification comes from the fact that there are three interested parties- the clients, the end users and the software developer. The requirements document has to be such that the client and the user can understand easily, and the developers can use it as a basis for software development. Due to the diverse parties involved in software requirement specification, a communication gap exists. This gap arises 
when the client does not understand software or the software development processor when the developer does not understand the client’s problem and application area of SRS bridges this communication gap.

SOFTWARE OVERVIEW
     2.6.2.1 Python
python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high- level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language. Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object- oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer especially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python. Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, Smalltalk, and UNIX shell and other scripting languages. Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.
Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library. Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.The Python 2 language, i.e. Python 2.7.x, was officially discontinued on 1 January 2020 (first planned for 2015) after which security patches and other improvements will not be released for it. With Python 2's end- of-life, only Python 3.5.x and later are supported. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. A global community of programmers develops and maintains Python, an open source reference implementation. A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation, manages and directs resources for Python and Python

development.
Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.
Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl's "there is more than one way to do it" motto, Python embraces a "there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it" design philosophy. Alex Martello, a Fellow at the Python Software foundation and Python book author, writer that “To describe something as ‘clever’ is not considered a compliment in the python culture.” Python’s developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non-critical part of the Python reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity. When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use Pippy, a just-in-time compiler. Python is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.


2.6.2.2 Django
Django is a Python based free and open-source web framework, which follows the model-template-view (MTV) architectural pattern. Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database driven websites. The framework emphasizes reusability and pluggability of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself. Python is used throughout, even for settings files and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.
Despite having its own nomenclature, such as naming the callable objects generating the HTTP responses views, the core Django framework can be seen as an MVC architecture. It consists of an object-relational mapper (ORM) that mediates between data models (defined as Python classes) and a relational database (Model), a system for processing HTTP requests with a web templating system (View), and a regular-expression-based URL dispatcher (Controller).

Also included in the core framework are:

A lightweight and standalone web server for development and testing.
A form serialization and validation system that can translate between HTML forms and values suitable for storage in the database.
A template system that utilizes the concept of inheritance borrowed from object- oriented programming.
A caching framework that can use any of several cache methods
Support for middleware classes that can intervene at various stages of request processing and carry out custom functions
An internal dispatcher system that allows components of an application to communicate events to each other via pre-defined signal.
An internationalization system, including translations of Django's own components into a variety of languages
A system for extending the capabilities of the template engine
An interface to Python's built-in unit test framework
Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs

Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML)
It is the standard mark-up language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
Web brow sers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
HTML  elem  ents  are  the  building  blocks  of  HTML  pages.  With  HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
Tags such as <imp /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags

but use them to interpret the content of the page.
HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content..
2.6.2.3 Java script
It is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi- paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event. JavaScript is an easy to learn and powerful scripting language, widely used for controlling web page behavior.
JavaScript can function as both a procedural and an object oriented language. Objects are created programmatically in JavaScript, by attaching methods and Properties to otherwise empty objects at run time, as opposed to the syntactic class definitions common in compiled languages like C++ and Java. Once an object has been constructed it can be used as a blueprint (or prototype) for creating similar objects.
.
     2.6.2.4 Cascading stylesheets
It is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, Math or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
2.6.2.5 MySQL
MySQL is an Oracle-backed open source relational database management system (RDBMS) based on Structured Query Language (SQL). MySQL runs on virtually all platforms, including Linux, UNIX and Windows. Although it can be used in a wide range of applications, MySQL is most often associated with web applications and online publishing.


MySQL is an important component of an open-source enterprise stack called

WAMP. WAMP is a web development platform that uses Linux as the operating system, Apache as the web server, and MySQL as the relational database management system and PHP as the object-oriented scripting language. (Sometimes Perl or Python is used instead of PHP.)
Originally conceived by the Swedish company MySQL AB, MySQL was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 2008 and then by Oracle when it bought Sun in 2010. Developers can use MySQL under the GNU General Public License (GPL), but enterprises must obtain a commercial license from Oracle. Today, MySQL is the RDBMS behind many of the top websites in the world and countless corporate and consumer-facing web-based applications, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

MySQL features

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PARADIGM APPLIED
The most familiar model is the waterfall model. This model has five phases: Rrequirement analysis and specification, design, implementation and unit testing, integration and system testing, and operation and maintenance












2.7SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PARADIGM APPLIED

Requirement analysis and specification phase
This phase produces a large document in natural language which contains the entire system analysis, and the document is known as SRS

Design phase
The goal of this phase is to transform SRS into a structure suitable for implementation. Overall software architecture is defined works are performed. Output of this phase is known as software design description(SDD)

Implementation and unit testing phase
The design is implemented, and the system is subjected to unit testing. Unit testing is the process of testing the small modules for checking errors.

Integrational system testing phase
It is a very important phase as the effective testing will deliver a high quality software product, user satisfaction, no maintenance, and more reliable result. It is very expensive. It is performed to determine the interface between the modules is correct. System testing is testing the entire system before delivery of the software.

Operation and maintenance phase
It is a task that every development team has to face when the product is delivered to the customer, and is operational. Software maintenance is a broad activity which includes error correction, capability enhancement and optimization.









































3.SYSTEM DESIGN

INTRODUCTION
System design is the process of defining the Architecture, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. System design could be seen as the application of systems theory to product development. There is some overlap with the disciplines of system analysis, systems architecture and systems engineering.
TYPES OF SYSTEM DESIGN
Logical Design
Logical design pertains to an abstract representation of the data flow, inputs and outputs of the system. It describes the inputs (source), outputs (destinations), databases (data stores), procedures (data flows) all in a format that meets the user requirements.
Physical Design
Physical design relates to the actual input and outputs processes of the system. It focuses on how data is entered into a system, verified, processed, and displayed as output.
Architectural Design
It is also known as high level design that focuses on the design of system architecture. It describes the structure and behavior of the system. It defines the structure and relationship between various modules of system development process.
Detailed Design
It follows Architectural design and focuses on development of each module.
Conceptual Data Modelling
It is representation of organization data which includes all the major entities and relationship. System analyses develop a conceptual data model for the current system that supports the scope and requirement for the proposed system.

3.2 INPUT DESIGN
Input design is a part of the overall design. The input methods can be broadly classified. Internal controls must be established for monitoring the number of inputs and for ensuring that the data are valid. The basic steps involved in input design are:
              * Review input requirements.
              * Decide how the input data flow will be implemented.
              * Decide the source document.
              * Prototype online input screens.
              * Design the input screens.

The quality of the system input determines the quality of the system output. Input specifications describe the way data enter the system for processing. Input design features can ensure the reliability of the system and produce result


OUTPUT DESIGN
A quality is one, which meets the requirements of end user and present the information clearly. In any system results of processing are communicated to the user and to the other system through outputs. In the outputs design it is determined how the information is to be displayed for immediate need.
It is the most important and direct source information is to user. Efficient and intelligent output design improves the system’s relationships with the user and helps in decision making. The objectives of the output design are to convey the information of all the past activities, current status and to emphasis important events. The output generally refers to the results and information that is generated from the system. Outputs from computes are required primarily to communicate the result of processing to the users.
Output also provides a means of storage by coping the results for later reference in consolation. There is a chance that some of the end users will not actually operate the input data or information through workstations but will see the output from the system.
Two phases of the output design are:
Output Definitions
Output Specification

DATABASE DESIGN
A database is a collection of interrelated data stored with minimum redundancy to serve many users quickly and efficiently. The general objective is to make information access easy, quick, inexpensive and flexible for users. The general theme behind a database is to integrate all information. Database design is recognized as a standard of management information system and is available virtually for every computer system. In database design several specific objectives are considered:
Ease of learning and use
Controlled redundancy
Data independence
More information at low cost
Accuracy and integrity
Recovery from failure
Privacy and security

Designer 
Designer can create 3D visual of the building or house. User can access the 3D visual as per the request.

Contractor 
Contractor is responsible for providing all the building material and equipment needed to run the project. It is the contractor’s responsibility to verify the vendors and ensure the quality of the material coming on the construction site.














































      4.SYSTEM TESTING AND IMPLEMENTATION   
	 
4.1 TESTING
The term software testing is defined as to find for the errors in the application that might lead to fault or failure of the whole application. There are testing conditions that the system must pass to says that it is tested and working properly. The quality and reliability are also attained by going through the process of testing.

Black box testing– Internal system design is not considered in this type of testing. Tests are based on requirements and functionality. 
White box testing– This testing is based on knowledge of the internal logic of an application’s code. Also known as Glass box Testing. Internal software and code working should be known for this type of testing. Tests are based on coverage of code statements, branches, paths, conditions. 
Unit testing – Testing of individual software components or modules. Typically done by the programmer and not by testers, as it requires detailed knowledge of the internal program design and code may require developing test driver modules or test harnesses

Incremental integration testing – Bottom-up approach for testing i.e., continuous testing of an application as new functionality is added; Application functionality and modules should be independent enough to test separately done by programmers or by testers. 
Integration testing – Testing of integrated modules to verify combined functionality after integration. 
Modules are typically code modules, individual applications, client and server applications on a network, etc. This type of testing is especially relevant to client/server and distributed systems. 
Functional testing – This type of testing ignores the internal parts and focus on the output is as per requirement or not. Black-box type testing geared to functional requirements of an application. 
System testing– Entire system is tested as per the requirements. Black-box type testing that is based on overall requirements specifications, covers all combined parts of a system. 
End-to-end testing– Similar to system testing, involves testing of a complete application environment in a situation that mimics real-world use, such as interacting with a database, using network communications, or interacting with other hardware, applications, or systems if appropriate. 

Sanity testing– Testing to determine if a new software version is performing well enough to accept it for a major testing effort. If application is crashing for initial use, then system is not stable enough for further testing and build or application is assigned to fix. 
Regression testing– Testing the application as a whole for the modification in any module or functionality. Difficult to cover all the system in regression testing so typically automation tools are used for these testing types. 
Acceptance testing -Normally this type of testing is done to verify if system meets the customer specified requirements. User or customer does this testing to determine whether to accept application. 
Load testing– It’s a performance testing to check system behavior under load. Testing an application under heavy loads, such as testing of a web site under a range of loads to determine at what point the system’s response time degrades or fails. 
Stress testing– System is stressed beyond its specifications to check how and when it fails. Performed under heavy load like putting large number beyond storage capacity, complex database queries, continuous input to system or database load.

Performance testing– Term often used interchangeably with „stress‟ and „load‟ testing. To check whether system meets performance requirements. Used different performance and load tools to do this. 

Usability testing– User-friendliness check. Application flow is tested, can new user understand the application easily, Proper help documented whenever user stuck at any point. Basically, system navigation is checked in this testing. 
Install/uninstall testing– Tested for full, partial, or upgrade install/uninstall processes on different operating systems under different hardware, software environment. 

Recovery testing– Testing how well a system recovers from crashes, hardware failures, or other catastrophic problems. 

Security testing– Can system be penetrated by any hacking way. Testing how well the system protects against unauthorized internal or external access. Checked if system, database is safe from external attacks. 


Compatibility testing– Testing how well software performs in a particular hardware/software/operating system/network environment and different combination s of above. 

Comparison testing– Comparison of product strengths and weaknesses with previous versions or other similar products. 

Alpha testing– In house virtual user environment can be created for this type of testing. Testing is done at the end of development. Still minor design changes may be made as a result of such testing. 

Beta testing– Testing typically done by end-users or others. Final testing before releasing application for commercial purpose. 
IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation is the stage in the project where the theoretical design is turned in to a working system and is giving confidence and effectiveness. It involves careful planning investigation of the current system and its constraints on implementation design of methods to achieve the change, over an evaluation of change over methods. A part from planning major tasks of preparing the implementation is education and training of the users. The more complex system is being implemented the more evolved will be the system analysis and design efforts required for the implementation. An implementation coordinating committee based on policies of the individual organization has been appointed. The implementation process begins with repairing a plan for the implementation of the system. According to this plan the activities are to be carried out, discussions made regarding the equipment has to be acquired to implement the system. Implementation is the final and the most important phase. The most critical stage in achieving a successful new system and in giving the users confidence is only after through testing is done and if it is found to work according to the specification. This method also offers the greatest security since the old system can take over if the errors are found or inability to handle certain type of transactions while using the new system.
VALIDATION CHECKS
A validation check ascertains that the value (or data) input into a computer is valid. Validation checks are performed automatically by computer to ensure that entered data is correct and reasonable. Validation means check the input submitted by the user. There are two types of validation are available in PHP. They are as follows –
Client-Side Validation − Validation is performed on the client machine web browsers.

Server-Side Validation – After submitted by data, the data has sent to a server and perform validation checks in server machine
4.4 SECURITY
The protection of computer-based resources that includes hardware,software, data, procedures and against unauthorized use or natural.
Integrity
Privacy
Disaster is known as system security.
System security can be divided into four related issues.
Confidentiality
Security
Data security is the protection of data from loss, disclosure, modification and destruction.
System Integrity refers to the power functioning of hardware and programs, appropriate physical security, and safety against external threats such as eavesdropping and writes tap in



































































                  5.CONCLUSION





































CONCLUSION

To conclude, this project would help a lot of people to find the right people to construct a building, and have an estimate of the construction. This site also acts as a platform for the freelance workers to find a job. The contribution this project would make is that it would eliminate the need of middle men in the construction field, also reduce the cost of construction, they also can find the architects, civil engineer, 3D designers and contractors under a single roof. This project aims to help the users find more architects, designers, and constructors based on what they like and also act as a platform for the Architects, Designers and Constructors to find more customers and grow their business. This also helps the customers to find the people needed for the construction in a quicker method and do not need to ask around for finding new architects. This site helps the Architects, Designers and Constructors those are new in this field find customers and grow their business, this also help the customers to find the Architects, Designers and Constructors for low cost and thus reduce the construction cost.
